# COVID-19 Modelling

Work in progress state space model of the corona pandemic.

## Setup

### Get the code
This repo contains a submodule `post_lin_smooth`, the easiest way to get the full code base is to recursively clone this repo by running:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:jackonelli/covid_state_space_model.git
```

### Dependencies

Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Get data from C19.se

Download data from https://c19.se/ to a local JSON file:

```bash
# Make sure that the current directory is the repo root
python src/c19_se.py --output-file <name-of_data-file>.json
```

### Examples

The `src` directory contains example scripts to demonstrate the posterior linearization,
they are supposed to be run from the repo root.

```bash
python src/<name-of-example>.py
# E.g.
python src/affine_example.py
```

### TODO

- ~Setup CT test with tricky data, increased noise. Create situation where iterations are required.~
- ~Iterative version of SLR smoothing.~
- ~Na√Øve truncated sampling for FHM model(s)~
- ~Gauss sampling on subspace (states sum to 1)~
- ~Generalise SLR linearization to any(?) lin.~
- Create a class for partial SLR.
- Toy SIR model, in place but trunc. sampling not working.
- Impl partial SLR for FHM model(s)
